					This is a very minimal example of a register/login form using the OPAQUE protocol. Here are a handful
					of neat things to observe about the protocol:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>There is no password traffic. Check for yourself the exchange between the client and the server in the DevTools.</li>
					<li>The server authenticates itself. You can valdiate the server's identity based on its public key, that doesn't change.</li>
					<li>The protocol produces an "export key" that the server never learns and that is stable (i.e. it doesn't change).</li>
					<li>The protocol produces a "session key" during login known by both parties and that changes every time you login.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The export key can be used to encrypt data the server should never learn, but that you want to recover later,
					and the session key can be used to encrypt communications between you and the server for example. The only
					thing limiting what you can do with these keys is your creativity!
				</p>
